When she was speaking about it, she claimed that it was incredible When asked about her personality, she responded In a word, and it's been sweet. It's great that I've had the chance to try my hand at various television shows.</p><p>To avoid being pigeonholed into a specific category is a great feeling. Seeing people from all walks of life portrayed in so many different ways has been fascinating. Working on something fresh is always interesting, and you pick up useful skills with every project. To me, that's what maintains the drama.</p><p>Gently, but I was so young that I didn't fully grasp the concept of being pigeonholed. I was really happy to be working in the film industry, period. It was a blessing just to be there, even if I had no idea what I was doing. Actually, I wasn't all that concerned about being typecast. That's exactly how things worked out. To my great fortune, I've been able to work on a wide variety of projects, each of which has provided me with valuable experience.</p><p>And it's been awesome: it just sort of occurred that way. The <strong>actress </strong>acknowledges that she may have been naive about the dangers of typecasting when she played the role at such a young age but counts herself as fortunate to have since participated in projects that have allowed her to play various characters and tell a variety of stories. Furthermore, anyone who saw her debut in the entertainment industry may not have recognized that she lacked the necessary experience.</p><h2>The Role</h2><p>Her guest spot was supposed to last just one episode, but she became such a fan favorite that she was kept on for several more seasons. She has dual motives: she wants to be taken seriously as an adult, and she also wants to safeguard her neighborhood. Although she was only a teenager at the time, she carried herself in a manner befitting an adult. It was her very first performance in front of an audience, but she quickly became an important figure to look up to for young women worldwide. Her admirers made it a point to convey to her how much she had motivated them. In only a single year, the number of people who follow her on Instagram has nearly reached one million.

Working with other A-listers gave her the confidence to share her thoughts and bring her own style and personality to the role. Her acting résumé reveals that she has a great deal of experience, even though she is still quite young.</p><p>She is getting her start in the film industry by directing an adaptation of a <strong>narrative </strong>she penned when she was very young, which is in some ways based on her own life. Someone has already committed to producing the script. She claims that the hidden project depicts a girl and her relationship with her eating issue in a positive way that is not always dark. This is something that she has discussed.</p><p>After hearing her say that writing was a great privilege, I became inspired to compose additional literature and perhaps even direct it in the near or far future. I plan to understand the field in terms of both what it is and what it has to offer.</p><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1666605102922.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>She will play an orphan who has grown up on a devastated Earth and must learn to reconcile her natural inclination toward wrath and rebellion with her need for love and acceptance, as well as the possibility that she is the only one who can save the planet. She will grow up on a planet that has been destroyed. </p><p>There has been a lot of talk about it, and although we haven't heard anything about a release date, we think it will be well worth the wait. In the future, not only do we look forward to seeing her in a broad variety of roles, but we also can't wait to hear more of the actress' one-of-a-kind perspective expressed in the form of innovative writing, production, and performance. In only a single year, the number of people who follow her on Instagram has nearly reached one million. We are excited to see what the future holds for this former noblewoman, even though it may take some time to get used to the fact that we won't always see her dressed in full medieval garb.</p>",

      "main_title": "Greatest Idris Elba Performances",
      "description": "A renowned British actor who first came to public attention through his work in shows",
      "keywords": "hottest man, Mandela, Idris Elba",
      "subtitle": "Greatest Idris Elba Performances",
      "content": "<p>Elba originally enhanced his fame profile by securing a consistent part in movies. Since his humble beginnings, Elba has come a long way since then. There is no doubt that he has played a variety of parts that have brought him recognition before his entrance. Even though Elba is recognized for his excellent looks to the point where People magazine called him the hottest manhe is so much more than just a lovely face.</p><p>In point of fact, Elba has successfully established himself to prove as an actor, to the point that he was honored with award for his contributions to the field of drama. The following is a ranking of Idris Elba's top performances in order. Award for Outstanding Actor in a Television Movie, Mini-Series, or Dramatic Special for Idris Elba. Elba's performance in Luther garnered him a lot of international recognition and even led to his being cast in Pacific Rim.</p><h2>Zootopia</h2><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1666605101086.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>Perhaps one of Elba's lesser-known performances is that of Chief Bogo in the Disney film Zootopia, which won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature Film. The movie's plot follows the adventures of Judy Hopps, a rabbit from the countryside who goes to the city of Zootopia to fulfill her ambition of joining the city's police force. But when Judy finally gets there, the city turns out to be less hospitable to her than she had anticipated it would be. Chief Bogo, who is actually a Cape buffalo, is in charge of the police department in Zootopia. When Judy first arrives, Bogo gives her a hard time and continues questioning her police work until she demonstrates that she is worthy of his respect. Even though he has a harsh exterior, Chief Bogo is an interesting and likable figure.</p><h2>Voice In Jungle Book</h2><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1666605101257.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>Elba has been able to get an increasing number of roles in the field of voice acting throughout the course of his career because of the highly unique quality of his speaking voice. In the live-action adaptation of The Jungle Book, he performed the predatory beast known as Sheer Kahn, which brought the character to life while at the same time being evocative of the animation version's Sheer Kahn. While Mowgli is making his way through the jungle with the assistance of Bagheera, the puma, to find some of his kind. The latter has a personal interest in feasting on Mowgli. Bagheera, the puma, is helping Mowgli.</p><h2>Roboelba</h2><p><strong><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1666605102629.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></strong></p><p>In 2019, a spin-off of the enduringly successful Fast and Furious movie series called Fast and Furious Presents: Hobbs and Shaw were released. The movie follows Deckard Shaw and Luke Hobbs as they work together to defeat a terrorist danger to the globe that has been cybernetically upgraded. Brixton Lore, a former MI6 agent who is now a terrorist working for Eton, is played by Elba. Before joining Eton, Brixton worked with Deckard Shaw. Brixton was shot in the head by Deckard during one particularly bloody encounter between the two, but Eteon spared his life and gave him cybernetic upgrades.</p><h2>Luther</h2><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1666605101595.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>In the TV show Luther, DCI John Luther must prosecute criminals as killer Alice Morgan continues to elude him. In this suspenseful crime novel, Elba portrays the lead role. Generally receiving favorable reviews, Luther aired for a total of five seasons and won several honors, including the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actor in a Television Movie, Mini-Series, or Dramatic Special for <strong>Idris Elba</strong>. Elba's performance in Luther garnered him a lot of international recognition and even led to his being cast in Pacific Rim.</p><h2>Freedom</h2><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1666605101331.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom, a biographical movie based on Nelson Mandela's autobiography Long Walk to Freedom, tells the life narrative of the former president of South Africa, Nelson Mandela, from his early struggles to the challenges he encountered while attempting to restore a segregated country. As Nelson Mandela in this movie, Elba gained greater credibility as a professional actor for his depiction of the revered revolutionary. His work got him nominations for the Artist of the Year ABFF Hollywood Award and the Best Actor in a Motion Picture - Drama Golden Globe.</p><h2>No Nation Beasts</h2><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1666605101861.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>In Beasts of No Nation, a teenage orphan named Agu is educated to fight for the rebels by a warlord named Commandant. All of this occurs during the African civil war and shines a light on the misery endured by civilians, emphasizing the challenges experienced by boys who are abducted and taught to be child soldiers. Elba plays the ruthless Commandant in the film adaptation of the same-named book Beasts of No Nation.</p><p>The movie received several nominations, including five Film Independent Spirit Award nominations, and Abraham Attah and Idris Elba won Best Male Lead and Best Supporting Male, respectively. The movie has received much appreciation from critics, and Attah was even given the Marcello Mastroianni Award at the Venice International Film Festival. One of the numerous war movies available to view right now on Netflix is Beats of No Nation.</p><h2>Squad</h2><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1666605101020.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>Elba's performance as the sanest guy in a room full of insane, convoluted anti-heroes is a highlight of Bloodsport. When hearing Polka-Dot Man's subdued joy at the prospect of death, the character's gradual, resigned exasperation as he mutters, Oh, for fucks sake, is symbolic of the sardonic humor of James Gunn's DC comics version. Bloodsport, whose real name is Robert DuBois, is a heavily armed mercenary with no option but to go through with Amanda Waller's (Viola Davis) disastrous plan to send Task Force X to Corto Maltese and wipe out all trace of Project Starfish there.</p><p>Elba gets plenty of opportunities to show off his comic talents thanks to Gunn's sharp scripting, and he also gets to play the expert shooter in the group. The character's startling dread of rats is not only a comic beat but also has a fulfilling journey and conclusion, especially for someone who once hit Superman with a Kryptonite bullet.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Musk is the creator of many companies, including the electric vehicle firm Tesla, the space exploration company SpaceX, and the startup Neuralink, which is working to build high bandwidth brain-machine interfaces to connect people and computers. The extraordinary performance and management ability that <strong>Elon Musk</strong> has to make difficult tasks seem to be relatively easy is one of the things that makes him so amazing.</p><p>Elon Musk is well-known for his outrageous statements and the concepts he proposes. Musk, born in South Africa and the creator of the <strong>electric vehicle</strong> firm Tesla and the space exploration company SpaceX, has some wacky views about what the future may hold. His ideas include creating a human colony on Mars with the help of affordable space travel, connecting our brains to computers, and developing micro-satellites to provide low-cost internet access to the general public.</p><p>One of his most notable inventions is the Hyperloop, a futuristic transportation system. As a direct consequence of all of this, Musk is widely regarded as one of our day's most contentious and singular businesspeople. Keep scrolling to learn some fascinating information about Elon Musk and his innovative company, Tesla, which can be found further down the page. These are most likely facts that you are already familiar with. Here is some information about the tech millionaire who is taking over the world and Mars that you may not already know.</p><h2>1. He Was Born In South Africa </h2><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1666605102781.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>Elon Musk was born in Pretoria, South Africa, in 1971, and he remained there until he immigrated to Canada in June 1989, when he was approximately 17 years old. Because his mother has Canadian citizenship, moving there was a lot simpler than it would have been otherwise. Following his successful application for a Canadian passport, he subsequently relocated to the United States.</p><h2>2. His First Creation Was A Game In The Beginning</h2><p>Musk came up with the idea for the space combat video game Blastar when he was only 12 years old in 1984. The game's source code was written up in PC and Office Technology Magazine and was available for purchase for $500. In addition, a cloned version of the original game may be found on the internet.</p><h2>3. He Dropped Out Of Stanford </h2><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1666605102119.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>Musk attended the University of Pennsylvania, where he received two bachelor's degrees: one in the field of physics and another in the field of economics. At 24, he was allowed to enrol in the PhD Physics programme at Stanford; nevertheless, he decided to leave the school after just two days to launch his very first business. Musk has underlined that his firms are recruiting individuals even if they do not have a \"conventional\" educational background in many of the interviews he has given. You have what it takes to work with Elon Musk if you have the talents, even if you do not necessarily have a degree in the relevant field.</p><h2>4. His Initial Business Was Called Zip2</h2><p>Zip2 was Elon's first venture as an entrepreneur, and it was a technology firm that provided an online business directory. After obtaining an investment of $3 million, the business was rebranded as Zip2 and given a new name. Previously, it was known as Global Link Information Network.</p><h2>5. He Has Never Agreed To Receive Compensation From Tesla</h2><p>The company also stated that Musk's salary in 2020 will practically plummet to zero.</p><h2>6. He Bought An Automobile From The James Bond Series</h2><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1666605101392.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>In 2013, Elon Musk paid almost one million dollars (to be more accurate, $968,000) to acquire a Lotus Espirit automobile featured in The Spy Who Loved Me at an auction in London.</p><h2>7. He Appeared In Popular TV Series and Sitcoms</h2><p>Unbeknownst to many, Musk has made guest appearances on a number of today's most prominent television programmes. In the episode of The Simpsons from 2015 titled \"The Musk Who Fell to Earth,\" in which he voiced a CEO, he appeared as a special guest on the show.</p><h2>8. He Was Close To Finalising the Deal to Sell Tesla to Google for $11 Billion</h2><p>Elon Musk came close to selling <strong>Tesla</strong> to Google in 2013 for a total of approximately $11 billion (in reality, $6 billion-plus a payment of $5 billion for manufacturing expansions). Then, the reputation of the company's products was not quite stellar. The firm had difficulty making large sales due to several problems and malfunctions. We are in serious trouble if we are unable to deliver these automobiles on time. Therefore, what line of work you were in is irrelevant to me. Your new employment entails the delivery of automobiles.</p><h2>9. He Is The Embodiment Of Iron Man's Tony Stark</h2><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1666605101636.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>Robert Downey Jr. has acknowledged that the character of Tony Stark in the film Iron Man, which was released in 2008, was inspired by Elon Musk. Believe it or not. Even in the sequel to Iron Man, which was released in 2010, the tech millionaire made a cameo appearance.</p><h2>10. He Is the Founder of Eight Different Businesses (So Far)</h2><p>It is well worth one's time to follow Elon Musk on his path since he is making history. Even while some of his acts or sayings (and even tweets) may occasionally be controversial, I am very confident that regardless of whether you are an entrepreneur or a techie, you will be able to discover at least one area of his life from which you can draw inspiration.</p><p>Join Medium and read every one of their stories by becoming a member.

      "keywords": "relationship, father, celebrity, family",
      "subtitle": "Celebrity Dads Who Have A Bad Relationship With Their Kids",
      "content": "<p>Becoming a father is a very straightforward process, but actual fatherhood is what truly matters. True fatherhood requires love, dedication, the willingness to make sacrifices and share responsibility, and the inability to turn one's back on one's own children. They appear in various forms and in large numbers, ranging from abusive to absentee fathers. And in a time when dysfunctional parenting is sweeping the nation like a wildfire, we can hardly be surprised that Hollywood is right on its heels.</p><p>After he ridiculed her new partner and called her a dragon in front of their son, she was so appalled by his behaviour that she sought to cut off all phone communication with their child. The entertainment industry is home to more than its fair share of truly terrible celebrity fathers, the most of whom cannot even recognise and adore their children without acting as if they do not exist.</p><p>On the other hand, a discussion about absentee fathers might appear unfinished if we fail to mention Lot, the original deadbeat dad. Suppose it's any solace to you. The fact that he got intoxicated and had sex with his daughters resulted in the future patriarchs of Moab and Ammon. This biblical figure is one of the first examples of a parent who has failed miserably in their role and is also one of the creepiest. On the other hand, however, there aren't that many other celebrities that can compete with him on the same level.</p><h2><strong>The Father Thief</strong></h2><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1666605099797.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>Mathews Knowles is an embarrassment. In addition to being accused of having multiple indiscretions, including one that resulted in a lovechild that he has essentially ignored, she has also accused him of stealing money from his famous daughter. After the court ruled in the lady's favour, he was fired from her management group. Mathew and Queen Bey have long symbolised a tumultuous father-daughter relationship. He briefly left her mother when his daughter was just two months old and returned only to ensure that his intrusive management takes the path of success in show business. His absence from her childhood was sporadic. The  Child singer insists that she has a loving connection with her father that has only improved since they stopped working together, despite the lawsuit.</p><h2><strong>The Bitter Truth</strong></h2><p><strong><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1666605102019.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></strong></p><p>Although he may be the father of the most renowned family in music history, he is more well-known for the immensely vicious and abusive ways he conducted his life. In the process of rearing not only him but also with other brothers, the father of the most electrifying singer amassed one of the greatest music groups of all time. In doing so, he used his authoritarian means to thrash his children into submission. The result was the most electrifying singer in the world. It should not come as a surprise that he did not have a very positive connection with his son. In an interview, he acknowledged beating his children with a strap and stated that he doesn't regret it. He also added that he doesn't feel bad about it since he kept them out of jail and kept them on the right path.</p><h2><strong>Secret Lovechild</strong></h2><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1666605101485.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>Until a few years ago, the famous actor lived a relatively normal life, blissfully unaware of the lovechild he had fathered with his maid. Their youngster did not appear to be aware of the identity of his biological father. Even though his mother worked there as a cleaner, he would still spend time with his father and her four children when he was a teenager. But as time went on, his likeness to his father became more and stronger, and so did the star's covert allowance for Mildred, which he had been paying her in the hopes of keeping the business arrangement a secret. On the other hand, he finally told his wife the truth about the affair shortly after he resigned from his position as governor. Nevertheless, the revelation that the kid was born just five days after his youngest son was the source of the actual discomfort in this situation.</p><h2><strong>Married To Step Daughter</strong></h2><p><strong><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1666605100980.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></strong></p><p>This is a pair whose scandalous relationship will continue to shock people worldwide for many years to come. Despite his great abilities as a filmmaker, we cannot ignore the fact that he married his adoptive daughter after photographing her while she was undressed. When the two first crossed paths, he was still married to his long-term partner, with whom he had adopted many children. In addition, Dill Date asserts that his marriage to Farrow has been so successful because she is his adopted daughter from her previous marriage, which ended in divorce when he was 56 years old. This unsuccessful marriage was to a composer. Even though he is 35 years older than she is, he has told the press that the two of us are a good fit for one other. I assumed the responsibilities of a father. Her response to a figurine representing a father was quite predictable.</p><h2><strong>A Day Without Papa</strong></h2><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1666605101184.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>When he was a former child star and possibly the most recognisable actor to have stepped into the roles of famous characters in long-running film series, he owed his ex-wife thousands of dollars in child support payments. He also needed to pay child support. After he ridiculed her new partner and called her a dragon in front of their son, she was so appalled by his behaviour that she sought to cut off all phone communication with their child. Furlong, notorious for admitting that he is an addict, has exhibited a lifelong pattern of poor choices, including arrests for drug use, excessive alcohol use, and legal issues. A few years ago, though, he levelled the most severe accusation against him: he claimed that their then-six-year-old child had tested positive for after spending time with his father.</p>",

      "content": "<p>It's quite probable that you have seen the late actor <strong>James Gandolfini</strong> on your television screen, whether now or twenty years ago if you were a television lover. He gained fame at the height of his acting career for portraying the renowned crime leader.</p><ul><li>The renowned actor was discovered unresponsive on the floor of his bedroom.</li><li>Gandolfini was urgently taken to the hospital, but a severe heart attack caused him to pass away.</li><li>The terrible passing of the legendary actor at the age of just 51 put the entire globe in shock.</li><li>It is now known that the actor had several opulent dinners and drank a lot of wine before the tragic event leading to his death.</li><li>The actor reportedly struggled with his drinking habits in the months before his passing.</li></ul><p>Many questioned the actor's cause of death because of his relatively youthful age. According to his family, nothing unusual has happened. A <strong>heart attack</strong> occurred. He said that it had a natural source. There was no criminal activity or drug usage. The hospital eventually acknowledged that he had a heart attack. The hospital likewise stated the cause of death as heart arrest. And even though a heart attack and cardiac arrest are two different medical conditions, they might be connected.</p><h2>Diet Played An Important Role In His Death</h2><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1666605100377.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>Stress, excessive alcohol use, a diet heavy in fat and high in salt, smoking, high cholesterol levels, high blood pressure, a sedentary lifestyle, and obesity are all factors that can raise the chance of developing heart disease. It is unmistakable that he was having difficulty coping with the stress. Even if his <strong>diet</strong> cannot be held entirely responsible for the heart attack that led to cardiac arrest, it is possible that it was one of the most significant risk factors.</p><p>According to the allegations, the actor had up to eight alcoholic beverages while savoring fried food and rich foie gras as the final meal he ate before having a heart attack. Additionally, the actor is said to have consumed fatty foods like foie gras.</p><p>Eating the appropriate foods may significantly enhance your health and lower the probability that you will develop certain chronic diseases; however, this recommendation is not being followed in this particular instance. Although it is unlikely that the specific cause of the untimely death of television's ultimate mafia boss from heart failure will ever be discovered, this event does highlight the significance of leading a healthy lifestyle to reduce the risk of an all-too-common heart disease-related mortality.</p><h2>His Death Shocked The Whole Industry</h2><p>The famous show's producer was taken aback and proclaimed Jimmy one of our day's most skilled, real, and sensitive performers. He deviated from the norm and stood out from the crowd in several ways. He was a comedy genius and a sexual magnet at his peak. I am fortunate to have known him as a friend and spent several exceptional years working with him.</p><p>I wish the best for him and his great, supportive family. Another team member expressed that I was devastated by the news of Jim Gandolfini's demise. He was a talented actor who never shied away from a challenge, treated everyone he met with dignity, and gave generously of his time and resources.</p><p>His co-stars, who all played important parts, remarked that he was one of their greatest friends in life and that he was always there for them when they needed him. Not only did he assist me in my professional life, but he also assisted me in my personal life; may God bless him. Together, he and I were continually volunteering our time to assist the military, and we even traveled to dangerous areas to pay the Marines a visit. We shall miss having him around.</p><h2>Disturbed Personal Life</h2><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1666605100782.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>In Hollywood, the famous actor is known for having established a reputation as an acting genius. But the singer did not appear to have the same success in his personal life, at least not when it came to his first marriage. His first wife said he battled drug and alcohol addiction during their time together. She characterized the actor as having increasingly significant problems with drugs and alcohol and conflicts during which the actor would repeatedly strike himself in the face out of frustration.</p><h2>Father-Son Bonding</h2><p>The tragic actor died after suffering a severe heart attack while on vacation. His stated purpose for being there was the Film Festival, where he was scheduled to appear as a guest of honor and collect an award; nevertheless, the actor intended the trip to also serve as an opportunity for the two of them to spend quality time together as a father and son. Since his son Michael had just finished his senior year of high school, Michael's father decided it would be a good idea to invite Michael along for the journey. He intended to blend the two, and they would spend some time together at that location.</p><p>The amount of time they could spend together was, sadly, limited. Fans have reported that an actor and his kid were seen dining at a restaurant in the area. The fans claim that they saw the actor and his son there. According to reports, both were in a very good mood throughout the lunch.</p><p>Michael was the one who discovered his dad passed out in the bathtub of their hotel room the next night. The youngster did not waste any time in contacting a member of the hotel's staff for assistance. However, despite several attempts to revive the actor at the hotel and the hospital, it was ultimately unsuccessful.</p>",

      "subtitle": "The 2 Decade - Long Relationship Of Crowley And Natalie Woods",
      "content": "<p>Mart Crowley was born in the United States on August 21, 1935. In 1957, he graduated from Catholic College in Washington, D.C., with a theatre degree and immediately departed for Nyc. When Natalie earned the lead role in the 1947 movie Miracle on 34th Street, <strong>Natalie Wood</strong> became a star for the first time. She would later develop into an actress nominated for an Academy Award three times. When Natalie and Mart first met, Wood set her sights on the central part in Zoe Kazan's 1961 film Splendor in the Grass to establish herself as a noteworthy actor.</p><p>As a production assistant on the movie, Crowley's daily duties included assisting Wooden and frequently accompanying her on the set. As stated by Crowley in the 2020 film Natalie Wooden: What Stays Behind, \"After that, we spoke a great lot.\" What started as a business relationship swiftly transformed into a reliable friendship, during which time secrets were shared.</p><p>When his controversial and ground-breaking play The Boys in the Band had its off-Broadway debut in 1968, Mart Crowley—a revolutionary gay author—would come to the world's attention. But Wood and Crowley were only genuinely close friends to one another. At the time, Wood and Wagner's marriage was in shambles. Crowley was aware of the situation because his relationship with Wood was increasing.</p><p>Crowley remarked, \"I can sense an issue in their marriage. Following claims that Wood had an affair with Splendor Warren Beatty, Wood and Wagner separated in 1961. Crowley became a member of Wood's inner circle after Wood employed her as her assistant after being cast as Maria in the 1961 West Side Story movie.</p><h2>Crowley was inspired by Wooden to write \"Boys in the Band\"</h2><p>Crowley's career subsequently suffered, and Wooden encouraged the author to produce authentic material, which eventually led to the production of Boys within the Band. Crowley told Playbill, \"Natalie did help me out after I wrote the play.\" \"And my career had been nothing but a sputtering failure, just as it had been at that time. … So, I was essentially discarded by brokers and written off as useless. My line of work was at a dead end. In reality, I had no money. I house-sat in Beverly Hills for the actress Diana Lynn, a very wealthy friend. With my time, I had to accomplish one thing. I thus wrote this play.</p><p>The play, which made its Off-Broadway debut in 1968, was acclaimed as innovative for its honest and accurate representation of homosexual individuals. It gave 1,000 performances and served as a dramatic prelude to the famous demonstrations at the Stonewall Inn in New York a year later. It began performing in theatres worldwide in 1970 and later became a movie film. And I think that explains why they got divorced, moved on to different partners, and had children, but these marriages didn't work out, and eventually, they found one another again and married. In 2018, it was brought back to Broadway with a cast that included Jim Parsons all of whom returned in their roles for a 2020 Netflix film adaptation.</p><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1666605100095.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p><h2>Crowley Supported Wood At Difficult Times</h2><p>Crowley would continue to be friends with both Wood and Wagner, but it was clear that he had a special bond with Wood. Wood was leery of opportunists since she had grown up in the Hollywood film industry and preferred to be around the few people she actually trusted. According to her daughter <strong>Natasha Gregson</strong>, Natalie Wood \"created a nucleus of people around her, including a lot of gay men and other people who felt marginalised, and my memory is that everyone was always talking about their feelings and emotions,\" Wagner in her memoir. The play, which made its Off-Broadway debut in 1968, was acclaimed as innovative for its honest and accurate representation of homosexual individuals. </p><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1666605100408.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p><h2>Wooden's Strange Death Occurred The Night Crowley Was Virtually Present</h2><p>Crowley was alive when British film producer Richard Gregson, whom Wooden later married, first caught her eye. Crowley was chosen as the child's godfather when Wooden gave birth to her daughter Natasha. In 1971, Wooden and Gregson announced their divorce. Even though her work in the 1969 comedy Bob &' Carol &' Ted &' Alice and her Golden Globe-winning performance.</p><p>In 1972, Wooden and Wagner remarried, with Wooden telling People that Wagner had \"grown into a person instead of a boy.\" In 1974, a daughter named Courtney was born. Crowley states, \"each of them has been besotted with the other.\" \"I suggest that they really, really liked one another. And I think that explains why they got divorced, moved on to different partners, and had children, but these marriages didn't work out, and eventually, they found one another again and married. Tragically, the second marriage ended the way it did, along with her passing away.</p><p>Thanksgiving 1981 saw Wagner, Wooden, and Christopher Walken, who was at the time her co-star in the film Brainstorm, travel to Catalina Island in California on the family cruiser Splendour. Crowley had been asked to attend but had declined the offer. According to reports, Wooden and Wagner argued on board about their relationship with their co-stars. Wooden reportedly left the cabin, and Wagner was unsuccessful in finding her for several hours.</p><p>The Splendour's dinghy was close by when Wooden's body was discovered floating in the water the following morning off Catalina. Although unintentional drowning was ruled as the cause of death, there were speculations that the details of Wooden's death weren't as they seemed in the years that followed. In 2012, citing fresh evidence, the cause of death was changed from \"unintentional\" to \"undetermined,\" Wagner once more came under fire for his role in what happened that evening.</p>",

      "main_title": "Everything You Need To Know About Joan Crawford",
      "description": "Even though Joan Crawford has been gone for more than four decades, she is still recognised as the archetypal Hollywood actress who emerged during the Golden Age of the industry",
      "keywords": "Joan Crawford, Crawford, Actress",
      "subtitle": "Everything You Need To Know About Joan Crawford",
      "content": "<p>Her film career began in 1925 and lasted until 1970; for most of that period, she was a leading lady surrounded by glitz and glamour. Crawford could pull off an Oscar victory for her role in Mildred Pierce, even though views on her acting ability have remained divided. She put a lot of effort into becoming an actor and a celebrity. The memoir written by her adopted daughter and portrayed by Faye Dunaway in the 1981 film adaptation of the book. The <strong>actress</strong> had a troubled existence, and here are some intriguing facts about her convoluted life.</p><h2>It Is Uncertain How Old She Is</h2><p><img src=\"http://47.104.212.164:3000/uploadsImg/1666605100183.jpeg\" alt=\"\"/></p><p>Everyone agrees that <strong>Joan Crawford</strong> (born Lucille LeSueur), also known as Lucille LeSueur Crawford, was born on March 23, even though there is no birth certificate for her. The year itself is a separate issue. Crawford always said that she was born in 1908, which would have made her 16 years old when she signed a deal with MGM in January 1925. Other sources, such as IMDb, give the year 1905, while others give the year 1904; however, the historian Donald Spoto contends that this year cannot be correct since her brother Harold was born in September of 1903. The year 1906 appears to be the year that most people agree is the most probable year that Crawford was born. However, there is no concrete data to support this.</p><h2>She Was Found Out While Singing In A Chorus</h2><p><img src=\"http://47.104.212.164:3000/uploadsImg/1666605101400.jpeg\" alt=\"\"/></p><p>At the time of the girl's birth, her father left the family to make ends meet, and her mother worked in a laundry to supplement their income. This may have been the origin of Joan's eventual phobia of clothes hangers. After her stepfather left the family, Lucille was given the name Billie Cassin and moved on with her life. By 1922, Billie was already dominating Charleston competitions in Kansas City, and she was ready to take her talents on the road, first to Chicago and then to New York. She was discovered by MGM producer Harry Rapf when she was performing in the chorus of The Passing Show in 1924. Following that, she was offered a contract and given a film test.</p><h2>A Vote From The General People Decided On Her New Moniker</h2><p><img src=\"http://47.104.212.164:3000/uploadsImg/1666605101908.jpeg\" alt=\"\"/></p><p>It was stated that there would be a public contest for renaming for $1,000, and the submission that ended up winning appeared to please everyone except for the bearer of the name, who felt it sounded like \"crawfish.\" William Haines, a close friend of hers and an occasional costar, gave her the moniker Crawford Cranberry.</p><h2>Crawford Was A Little Woman With A Redhead And A Freckled Face</h2><p><img src=\"http://47.104.212.164:3000/uploadsImg/1666605100729.jpeg\" alt=\"\"/></p><p>She looks to have a lot of presence on the screen, right? The lady's eyes and lips were undeniably enormous and striking, but the actual height of the woman was only around 5 feet 3 inches. In terms of the complexion and the colour of the hair, the freckles were covered up using cosmetics, and the hair was dyed a different hue to match the character. In addition, Crawford's appearances in colour were very uncommon until the film Torch Song was released in 1953. By that time, however, her image had achieved such a level of artificiality that the subject of her real hair colour was immaterial.</p><h2>There Was A Possibility Of Romantic Attraction Between Her And Clark Gable</h2><p><img src=\"http://47.104.212.164:3000/uploadsImg/1666605099780.jpeg\" alt=\"\"/></p><p>Crawford remained close to Clark Gable even though she had several boyfriends and four spouses, including actors Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Franchot Tone, and Phillip Terry, as well as the head of Pepsi-Cola, Alfred Steele. It is believed that Gable and Crawford carried on an affair off and on during their careers since they worked together in a record-setting eight pictures, the most of any other pair. Crawford also took over the role that Lombard was supposed to play in the film.</p><h2>She Adopted Her Children Via The Help Of Unlicensed Baby Brokers</h2><p><img src=\"http://47.104.212.164:3000/uploadsImg/1666605101730.jpeg\" alt=\"\"/></p><p>It was against the law for <strong>Crawford</strong> to adopt three children as a single parent in California; the children were Christina and twins Cathy and Cindy. She used unlicensed baby brokers and flew with baby Christina, born in Hollywood to a young lady who was not married at the time of her birth, first to New York and then to Nevada to adopt her legally. Her second kid, a boy, was adopted by the Terry family after Crawford had already started a family with Phillip. After a limited period, this kid was known by the name Phillip Terry II; however, after his parent's marriage ended, he was renamed, Christopher Crawford.</p><h2>She Was Labelled Box-Office Poison</h2><p><img src=\"http://47.104.212.164:3000/uploadsImg/1666605099869.jpeg\" alt=\"\"/></p><p>In 1938, Joan Crawford, Marlene Dietrich, Greta Garbo, and Katharine Hepburn were referred to as \"box-office poison\" by the Independent Theatre Owners Association of America. This was even though Crawford maintained a consistent spot in the Top Ten Money-Making Stars poll during the early and middle 1930s. Joan was great at making a return whenever she needed to, even though she had a string of parts below par. The actress had a troubled existence, and here are some intriguing facts about her convoluted life.</p><h2>On Set, She Had A Disagreement With Mercedes Mccambridge</h2><p><img src=\"http://47.104.212.164:3000/uploadsImg/1666605756208.jpeg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\" contenteditable=\"false\"/></p><p>If you've watched Johnny Guitar, you already know that some of the film's most iconic scenes. The alcohol-fueled dispute moved to the filming site in Arizona; for example, let's assume that at one time, McCambridge's clothing wound up sprawled out on the highway outside the actresses' hotel. This is just one example of how the conflict expanded. On the other hand, it seems that the infamous fight between Joan Crawford and Bette Davis during the production of Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? was fabricated for publicity. The year 1906 appears to be the year that most people agree is the most probable year that Crawford was born.</p>",

      "keywords": "Audrey Hepburn, Robert Matzen, Roman Holiday",
      "subtitle": "Everything You Need To Know About Audrey Hepburn",
      "content": "<p>There is probably a lot about <strong>Audrey Hepburn</strong> that you may not know. Audrey Hepburn's birthday was May 4. After that, He and his wife both went on to appear together in a production of Ondine on Broadway, and in 1954, they were married. </p><h2>1. The First Part That Audrey Hepburn Played Was In A Film Intended For Children</h2><p>Even though Dutch in Seven Lessons was released in 1948 and is categorized as a documentary on IMDb, the film is more accurately described as an instructional travel video. Hepburn has a role in the film as an airplane attendant. Watching it may not make much sense to you if you don't know Dutch, but you can do it by clicking on the link above.</p><h2>2. She Was Almost Starved To Death During World War II</h2><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1666605098681.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>It has been said that Hepburn suffered from an eating issue; however, her family has always maintained that her renowned trim figure was the consequence of her growing up during the war. She was only a teenager when the Nazis occupied her country and came close to passing away. According to statements made by her son Dotti to People in 2017, \"By the time the conflict was over, she was extremely near to death.\" According to him, by the time the war was over, she had \"jaundice and edoema,\" which her son thinks led to issues for the rest of her life. He said that she was affected by anemia for the remainder of her life.</p><h2>3. She Became A Member Of The Resistance In The Netherlands.</h2><p>In 1940, when the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands began, Hepburn and her mother were residing in Arnhem, and Hepburn remained in that city for the whole war. According to the book Dutch Girl: Audrey Hepburn in World War II, written by historian <strong>Robert Matzen</strong>, Hepburn was just 14 years old when the Resistance recruited her. According to reports, she was requested to carry meals to American and British pilots and \"inform them where to go and who would assist them.\" She is said to be fluent in English due to her years living in England.</p><h2>4. Hepburn Had Formal Training In Ballet Throughout Her Life</h2><p>Hepburn began her career as a dancer, and she always had the ambition to become a prima ballerina one day. She traveled from the Netherlands to London when she was 15 to study dance there. According to Helena Coan, the director of the documentary Audrey, which will be released in 2020, the fact that she was malnourished during the war prevented her from dancing professionally. According to what Coan said to Harper's Bazaar, \"She just did not have the fortitude.\"</p><h2>5. She Performed On Stage To Raise Money For The Resistance</h2><p>According to Dutch Girl, Hepburn participated in secret stage performances to raise money for the Resistance. These performances included musicals and ballets and were referred to as \"black evenings\" because the windows in the venues were blacked out to conceal the goings-on from German soldiers. Hepburn is quoted as saying that she participated in these secret performances by stating, \"I danced at recitals, devising the dances myself, I had a friend who played the piano, and my mother prepared the costumes,\" according to Matzen.</p><h2>6. She Met Her First Spouse At The Premiere Of The Movie Roman Holiday</h2><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1666605099133.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>At the British premiere of <strong>Roman Holiday</strong> in 1953, Hepburn made the acquaintance of actor and director Mel Ferrer. After that, they both went on to appear together in a production of Ondine on Broadway, and in 1954, they were married. During that time, she sent a letter to a close friend named Sir Felix Aylmer in which she said, \"We wish to keep it a dark secret in order to enjoy it without the 'press.'\"</p><p>Despite rumors of cheating on both sides (albeit more so on Ferrer's), the couple managed to stay married for 14 years and have a single child, a boy named Sean Hepburn Ferrer. In 1968, they went their ways, and she went on to have another son, Luca Dotti, with her subsequent husband, Andrea Dotti.</p><h2>7. Gregory Peck Was Scared Hepburn Would Make Him Appear Like A Jerk</h2><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1666605099292.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>When Hepburn was cast in the leading role of Princess Ann alongside Gregory Peck in the 1953 film Roman Holiday, she was a relatively inexperienced actress at the time. As a result, Peck would be the sole celebrity mentioned, and Hepburn would be credited with an \"introducing\" phrase and a lesser text size. Peck said, \"You've got to fix it because she'll be a huge star and I'll seem like a big jerk,\" but the other person refused. In the end, Hepburn was awarded her first and only Oscar for her performance in part, whereas Peck was not even nominated.</p><h2>8. Hepburn Was Nominated For Five Academy Awards Throughout Her Career</h2><p>Throughout her professional life, Hepburn was nominated for many awards, including five Academy Awards. She was nominated for an Academy Award for the first time for her performance in the film Roman Holiday, and she went on to win the Best Actress in a Leading Role award. She went on to get four more nominations in the same category over the following 15 years. Additionally, the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award was given to her posthumously by the Academy in 1993.</p><h2>9. She Has All Of The Egots</h2><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1666605099654.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>In 1954, the same year that she received an Academy Award for her performance in Roman Holiday, Hepburn also collected a Tony Award for her appearance as the lead character in the Broadway production of Ondine. Hepburn is one of just 16 people in history to have received all four of the most prestigious honors in the creative industries: the Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony. Sadly, Hepburn could only receive these honors after she passed away.</p>",

      "description": "White is a native Angeleno. Her career as an actress began in the 1940s, when she appeared on a number of radio programmes, and continued until 1949, when she became a regular \"girl Friday\" on Hollywood on Television. A few years later, she took over hosting duties, and in 1952, she co-founded production company Bandy Productions to pursue her own creative endeavours. Life with Elizabeth, a television sitcom, debuted later that year.",

      "content": "<p> In discussions about Betty White, fans frequently bring up the actress's age. She holds the record for the longest gap between performance- Emmy nominations, with her first coming in 1951 and her most recent coming in 2014; she is also the oldest Emmy nominee of all time and the oldest person to win a competitive Grammy Award and the oldest person to host Saturday Night Live.</p><p>White's longevity, meanwhile, is not without substance. She was one of the first women to have complete artistic freedom in front of and behind the camera in the 1950s when she was both a program presenter and an actress, as well as a producer, writer, and singer.</p><p>Even among fans of classic shows like The Mary Tyler Moore Show and The Golden Girls, there is more to this woman than most people realize today. Here are six interesting nuggets about the famous actor.</p><p>White's portrayal of the cunning and seductive \"Happy Homemaker\" program host, Sue Ann Nivens, won her widespread recognition. She was nominated for three Emmys for her efforts and ultimately took home two trophies in 1975 and 1976. Despite the show's cancellation in 1977, White continued to be a mainstay of American television, first with her series The Betty White Show (1977–78) and then with guest spots on shows like The Love Boat and Mama's Family.</p><h2>Life's Work </h2><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1666605100469.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>As her life's work, she's advocated for animal rights. White has been a member of the Los Angeles Zoo's board of directors since 1974, and his efforts on their behalf have raised millions of dollars. Because she gets along well with the animals, she is welcome to visit even when the facility is closed. </p><p>Good As It Gets, she turned it down because of a scene in which a dog is hurled down a laundry chute, even though she considers dogs, cats, horses, whales, and gorillas among her pals. Although she liked the Oscar-nominated script, she could not approve of the action.</p><p>In 2012, she had a half-hour meeting with President Obama at the White House, during which Bo, the presidential dog, sat on her lap. When asked what she would have done for a living if she hadn't gone into the show industry, she didn't think twice about saying \"zookeeper,\" even though this was a role that was off-limits to women in her youth. For decades, she has utilized her wealth, notoriety, and celebrity acquaintances to collect money for various animal-related charities, and she has even been known to adopt animals in need. She counts becoming an Honorary Forest Ranger as one of her proudest achievements.</p><h2>A Lot of Firsts Can Be Attributed to Her</h2><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1666605099758.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>In 1950, White was one of the first female performers to be considered for an Emmy nomination. When she was still a teenager living at home with her parents, Elizabeth was one of the first women to have complete creative control over her television show, co-creating, co-producing, and starring in the show Life With Elizabeth. It was in 1955 that she became the honorary mayor of Hollywood for being the first woman to produce a sitcom and the first woman to have her talk show. The first woman to win an Emmy for presenting a game show, she also made history.</p><p>Despite her reputation, she is a hopeless romantic at heart. This is White's third marriage. She had three marriages total; the first was to U.S. Army pilot Dick Barker in 1945; the second was to agent Lane Allen; the third was the genuine deal.</p><p>Starring Bea Arthur, Rue McClanahan, and Estelle Getty, White made her television debut as the nave and eternally upbeat Rose Nylund in the 1985 sitcom The Golden Girls. The show about a community of retired women in Miami was a smash hit.</p><p>Early in the 1960s, White was a regular on game programs. The popular game shows What's My Line and Password peaked around this time. When Alan Ludden met his co-hostess for Password, he immediately fell in love with her. For an entire year, she politely declined his marriage offers until one Easter They tied the knot back in 1963 and remained together till his untimely demise from stomach cancer in 1981.</p><h2>She and Her Pals Play Poker Regularly</h2><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1666605099745.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>Screw Thy Neighbor, a dealer's choice game in which each player decides whether to keep a card or pass it to their neighbor, is White's favorite. Everyone in the Pico Poker Club tournament plays for a brass cup that the winner gets to keep. If the winner doesn't return the game piece the next time it's used, they'll have to pay \"$2,000 or death, whichever is more suitable.\"</p><p>She was close with a well-known writer. Steinbeck, a writer, was a close friend of both her and Ludden. He was drafting his Nobel Prize acceptance speech the day they met, which is now one of her most valued belongings. One of these items is a black chiffon skirt she refuses to have cleaned because Steinbeck's renowned poodle soiled it. </p><p>In the early days of David Letterman's popularity, she was a devoted viewer. A longtime supporter of David Letterman, White first became a fan in his early years. She and Ludden are often regarded as Hollywood's \"discoverers,\" as he made his debut TV appearance on a game program they hosted together. (Mary Tyler Moore, a friend and co-star of his helped him out in a big way on the set of her variety show.) She toasted White's 89th birthday with him the day after he turned 89 by sharing a bottle of vodka on David Letterman's The Late Show.</p>",

      "description": "Jordan's penchant for gambling is another interesting fact about him. His urge to constantly boost the stakes left him on shaky ground, yet he is rumoured to have cajoled teammates into wagering on everything from golf and card games to rock-paper-scissors duels.",
      "keywords": "Officially, Nike, Jordan",
      "subtitle": "Facts of Michael Jordan About the Basketball Legend",
      "content": "<p>He was never officially kicked off the high school basketball team. The story of Jordan being cut from the basketball team in high school is a well-known aspect of his backstory, but the truth has been stretched a bit, much like a young Jordan stretching his neck on the chin-up bar to gain height. When Jordan tested out for the varsity team at Laney High School (North Carolina), he was placed on the junior varsity. However, he was never officially \"cut.\" </p><p>The fact that Laney desperately needed taller players contributed to their decision to pass on Jordan, despite the latter's 5'10\" height, in favor of his friend Leroy Smith's 6'7\". It is true that Jordan took this perceived affront as an incentive to work extremely hard to improve and that this paid off handsomely when a growth spurt caused him to suddenly reach a height of 6 feet, 3 inches by the time he was a junior.</p><h2> Collaboration </h2><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1666605099113.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>Jordan's successful career-long partnership with Nike almost didn't happen. When he first joined the NBA, he opted to wear Adidas, but a much smaller company, Spot-Bilt, soon courted him. Nike went all out to sign the Chicago Bulls rookie, offering him a then-astronomical $500 thousand per year for five years and the opportunity to design his sneaker.</p><p> Even after returning to Adidas one last time, Jordan insisted on signing with Nike even though the latter business could not match Jordan's asking price. This partnership was a marketing dream come true; by the end of 1985, Nike had made over $100 million off the Air Jordan brand, which had debuted in May of that year.</p><p>Michael Jordan displays his Air Jordan shoe. That year, Nike made almost $100 million thanks to its worldwide popularity, which began the trend of innovatively designed athletic footwear.</p><h2>Studied Cultural Geography in College</h2><p>Jordan graduated with a degree in cultural geography from UNC in 1986, even though he left school a year early to pursue a professional career. What does one do in that industry, exactly? Years later, during a Q&'A session at his basketball camp, he elaborated on this idea, saying that cultural geography is like a crash course in meteorology. So, if dunking over seven-footers wasn't going to work out for Jordan, forecasting the weather was his Plan B. That certainly puts a fresh spin on the meaning of \"Air Jordan.\"</p><p>Jordan went to his first golf course with a group that included future golf pro-Davis Love III. His experience of parring a hole that day gave this already-confident athlete the idea that he could play par all 18 with a little additional work. </p><p>In his pursuit of excellence, he infamously declined President George H.W. Bush's invitation to the White House so that he could get in as many practice rounds as possible. After that, from 2001 through 2014, he hosted the Michael Jordan Celebrity Invitational. </p><h2>The decision to Make Baseball His New Sport </h2><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1666605100198.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>Jordan's dad was the driving force behind his decision to make baseball his new sport. A few years before his shocking 1993 decision to abandon basketball for baseball, Jordan had begun to consider the possibility. James Sr. had always been a baseball fan, and after seeing Bo Jackson and Deion Sanders's success as multi-sport players, he urged his son to try his hand at baseball and football. </p><p>When James was killed in a carjacking in July 1993, Jordan wanted to carry on his father's boxing legacy, so he picked up a glove. Although he had a lot of trouble in his one season of minor league baseball, his ability to pick up a sport he hadn't played since high school amazed many. Their manager that year, Terry Francona, now says he thinks Jordan, had he continued at it, would have made it to the major leagues.</p><p>Following his death, businessman Richard Esquinas wrote a book about him and his wife, Michael and Me: Our Gambling Addiction...My Cry for Help! </p><p>Even though Jordan was never penalized by the NBA for gambling, the story lingered for years: NBA Commissioner David Stern secretly suspended him for a year so that Jordan could take a year off to play baseball.</p><h2>Collaboration with Nike</h2><p><img src=\"/uploadsImg/1666605101079.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p><p> He's profited over a billion dollars via his collaboration with Nike. Although Jordan had a stellar professional basketball career, winning six championships, five MVP honors, and ten scoring crowns, he only earned the distinction of highest-paid player in the NBA twice in his 15-year career. He didn't have to dig through the couch cushions for spare change because of companies like Coca-Cola, Gatorade, and Hanes. </p><p>His partnership with Nike, which I've already said, has turned out to be the most fruitful; by 2020, it will be public knowledge that Jordan has earned over a billion dollars from the company. After buying a controlling stake in (now Hornets) in 2010, he benefited from the franchises' valuation. After years of being revered as a basketball great, Jordan finally made it onto Forbes' list of billionaires in 2015.</p><p>The myth of Jordan getting cut from the basketball team in high school has long been a part of his narrative, but the truth has been slightly stretched, much like a young Jordan hanging from a chin-up bar to gain height. When Jordan tested out for the varsity team at Laney High School (North Carolina), he was placed on the junior varsity. However, he was never officially \"cut.\" And a major factor in that decision was that Laney needed taller players and drafted Jordan's 6'7\" friend Leroy Smith instead of him because of Jordan's height. The truth is that Jordan used this perceived snub as an incentive to work extremely hard to develop, which paid off handsomely when a growth spurt propelled him to a towering 6 feet, 3 inches by his junior year.</p>",
